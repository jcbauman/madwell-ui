Attached are two screenshots of a simple landing page. We would like you to attempt to re-create these screenshots into a simple web page/web app. The bulk of the work will test your ability to code out semi-complex layouts in HTML/CSS. Additionally, we would also like you to pull the image paths and captions with JavaScript via a JSON file we have hosted here: https://www.madwell.com/interview/index.php?f=data

A few additional notes to keep in mind:
Do not worry about making the design “pixel perfect”. For the purposes of this exercise, we’re more interested in seeing how you would broadly approach coding the composition of a complex layout than we are about precise typography, color hex values, or margins/padding values.
Any CSS tooling you want to use for the stying is fine, including a compiled language like SCSS, a CSS-in-JS solution like Styled Components, or just plain vanilla CSS. We would discourage the use of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma.
Please also feel free to use either vanilla/ES6 JavaScript or React. Any additional JavaScript tooling or packages may also be used when appropriate.
The images listed in the JSON file are not all the same dimensions. They should be intelligently cropped and centered to a size of 150 x 150px.
Some images in the JSON object will have a “caption” attribute while others will not. If the caption is present, please display it in bold white text.
For the purposes of this exercise, we will only look at your work at two viewport widths: 1250px (desktop) and 375px (mobile). Don’t worry about accounting for very large displays or tablets.
